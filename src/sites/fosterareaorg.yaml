    East Side, but the website for their business association was essentially
    non-existant."

    content: "The Foster Area Business Association is a group of allied businesses 
    in Portland, Oregon’s up-and-coming Foster-Powell neightborhood. Their old web 
    site was essentially non-existent, so they pursed a grant from the city to 
    commission a new one. Marina Martinez Consulting won the contact and hired me 
    to do the design and development.

    The budget was limited, so the site was designed to be simple yet usable, both 
    in design and functionality. Since it was likely to be further enhanced as more 
    money became available to the business association, I attempted to structure 
    its content to be as ameniable to change and improvement as possible."

    content: "To this end, the core of the site was built around a “member” post type, 
    each representing a differnent  member. Each member post object included metadata
    about their business, and could be categories by the type of business (i.e. 
    “Food/Drink”, “Professional Services”, etc) and their status (i.e “Active”, 
    “Board Member”, etc). This allowed for easy categorization, both for the people 
    managing the site, and for users visiting it. A group of randomly-selected members 
    are also dispalyed on the front page with each page load, to help bring awareness 
    to everyone involved in the organization."
