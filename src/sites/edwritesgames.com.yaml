    screenwriter, needed a website to server as a portfolio and point 
    of contact."

    content: "The design was created internally and approved by the client, 
    and I developed the WordPress backend to meet his needs. Some of this 
    project's notable challenges were:"
    items: 
      - "Custom post types to manage portfolio items, news micro-feed, 
        and endorsements"
      - "Metaboxes to make data entry easy for the client"
      - "Simple, elegant design"

    content: "As a portfolio and point of contact for clients, the site 
    needed to quickly present information with minimal fuss. Given that 
    my client is an individual and not a company with numerous employees,
     it was also important that the site be simple and intuitive to

    the extensive use of custom post types in the project also provide 
    a clear semantic framework when updating the site: Portfolio items 
    are simply \"Work,\" not some less-intuitive and semantically 
    inaccurate construction such as \"posts in the 'work' category.\""
