    content: "An alternative to WordPress's built-in `Nav_Walker`, \U0001F9D7
      Climber creates a more reasonable data structure, which can be interacted
      with directly or used to generate the HTML for a navigation menu. I built
      it because every time I had to customize a menu using `Nav_Walker` it was
      a very frustrating experience."
