description: Builds HTML with PHP in a pleasant, straightforward way.
technology:
  - php

  - type: text
    content: "Cyrus is a tool for creating HTML with PHP. It's not really a templating language, more a sort of wierd recreation of the DOM. I created it because I wanted a way to generate HTML using PHP object method chaining. It's a visually logical way of showing what gets generated, and it allows for programatically affecting what HTML is generated without wrapping raw tags in PHP."
