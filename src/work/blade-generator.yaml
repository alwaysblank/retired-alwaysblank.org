    content: "I've been using the [Roots](https://roots.io/) WordPress stack at
      work and for freelance for a few years now. The upcoming version of Sage,
      version 9, will include Blade templating (borrowed from Laravel). I
      noticed someone on the Roots forums [mention](https://discourse.roots.io/t/best-practice-resources-for-blade/8341/72)
      that it would be nice to have the capability to pre-render Blade
      templates on deploy instead of waiting for them to render on request,
      so I took decided now was a good time to learn how to write a WP-CLI
      plugin.

      The plugin is intended to adhere to the UNIX philosophy of making a
      program do one thing and do it well. All it does is render templates,
      but it does it quietly and elegantly."

    content: "This scans your active theme for any blade template files, and
      then renders them through Sage's Blade interface. It finds template files
      wherever they are, and uses the cache location described in your theme's
      Sage configuration, so it needs no configuration of its own. It doesn't
      prompt the user, so it can easily be run on deploy without user input."

      it will limit its seach to a directory you pass to it:"
